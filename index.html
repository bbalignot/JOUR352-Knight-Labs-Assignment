          <p>LeBron James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers as the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft, and he rapidly became the face of the franchise. In his first stint with the Cavs, he led the team to the NBA Finals in 2007 but lost to the San Antonio Spurs. He won two NBA MVP awards during his time in Cleveland before leaving for the Miami Heat in 2010. </p>
          <p>James won two championships in Miami and then returned to Cleveland in 2014, leading the team to its first-ever NBA title in 2016 and making good on his promise to the franchise before he left for the Heat. After another stint in Cleveland, he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018 and won his fourth NBA championship in 2020. Throughout his career, James has been widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, with a long list of accolades and accomplishments to his name.</p>
